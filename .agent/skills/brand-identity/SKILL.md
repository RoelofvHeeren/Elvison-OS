## When to use this skill

- When writing marketing copy, error messages, or documentation (Voice & Tone).
- Activates during the **Design** and **Implementation** phases of the Superpowers workflow.

## Workflow

    - [ ] If styling UI, check `resources/design-tokens.json`.
    - [ ] If writing code, check `resources/tech-stack.md`.
    - [ ] If writing copy, check `resources/voice-tone.md`.
2.  **Implementation**
    - [ ] Apply brand colors, typography, and spacing.
    - [ ] Follow tech stack constraints (e.g., Tailwind, React).
    - [ ] Use the defined brand voice (Professional, Approachable).
3.  **Verification**
