# TDD Guide (Red-Green-Refactor)

## Purpose
To ensure code quality, correctness, and maintainability.

## The Cycle
1. **RED**: Write a failing test. Reference the exact file and expected output.
2. **GREEN**: Write the minimal code to pass the test. Do not add extra features.
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the code structure without changing behavior.
4. **VERIFY**: Run all tests again to ensure no regressions.
