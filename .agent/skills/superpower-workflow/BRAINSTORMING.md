# Brainstorming Skill

## Purpose
To refine ideas before implementation. Prevent "garbage in, garbage out".

## Workflow
1. **Understand**: What is the root problem?
2. **Explore**: What are the alternatives? Why choose this path?
3. **Spec**: Define the behavior, not just the code.
4. **Approval**: Get user sign-off on the spec.
